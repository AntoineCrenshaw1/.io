  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Antoine Crenshaw and I got into coding as a way to past time and slowly fell in love with it over the years.
    Coding for me is therapeutic and that makes it very enjoyable for me. Being able to see the end and start of a project and to be able to call it mine.
